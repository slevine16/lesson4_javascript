### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Javascript is a client-side scripting language and the most popular one on the Internet. This means it is a light-weight programming that is executed in the client or software.
2. There are two ways to include Javascript into code. To embed in HTML, one must add the <script> tag. Then define the two attributes, src and type. The second way to add Javascript is as a separate file.
3. Variables are used to store data in memory. They are case sensitive and must begin with a letter or underscore. Since Javascript is a loosely typed language, a variable can take on any data type depending on the value it is assigned.
